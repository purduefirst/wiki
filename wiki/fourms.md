### Purdue FIRST Forums
Purdue FIRST Forums is an opportunity for high-school robotics students and their adult teachers/mentors to visit campus and learn about a variety of STEAM topics. This is a conference-style event where participants are invited to attend or provide presentations. Each presentation is 45-minutes in length, with five 1-hour sessions available across multiple classrooms each hour. PFP often partners with other Purdue Departments to provide parking, campus tours, and related content.

### 2025 Edition
For the first time, Purdue FIRST Forums was hosted at multiple locations across two weekends. This allowed a more diverse set of students to take advantange of the learning available at these types of events. Multiple sessions were "reflected" and streamed across locations, allowing for increased collaboration.
